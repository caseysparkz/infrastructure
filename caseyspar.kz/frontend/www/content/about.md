I'm Casey, a DevOps/IT/InfoSec professional with experience in FinTech information security and compliance, living
in _~~New Zealand~~ ~~Nevada~~_ California.

With six years of experience in finance and cryptotechnologies working in roles spanning from product to
infrastructure, and a deep understanding of information security management system (ISMS) requirements for SOC2
and ISO-27001 compliance, I mostly spend my time with (open source) infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration
management tools, building stateless and ISO-compliant infrastructure.
