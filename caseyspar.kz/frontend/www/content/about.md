I'm Casey.

I'm a DevOps, IT, and InfoSec professional with experience in the fintech and automotive industries, currently
based in the Bay area.

I've seven years of experience in finance and automotive technologies in roles spanning product
to infrastructure. I have a deep understanding of information security management system (ISMS) requirements for
both SOC2 and ISO-27001 compliance, though I mostly spend my time with infrastructure as code (IaC)
and configuration-management tools building stateless, replicable, and compliant infrastructure in the cloud
and on-premise.

I've experience with Terraforming AWS and Azure, and frequently write internal tooling (Python).
Kubernetes is still a weakness.

Prior to working in a techical role, I was a copywriter and, before that, a bartender.
